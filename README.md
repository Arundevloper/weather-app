## Assignment Overview:
The assignment involves developing a weather application using React.js that fetches real-time weather data and forecasts from the Tomorrow.io API. The purpose of the application is to provide users with accurate weather information based on their location input.

## How to Run the Application:
Clone the repository from GitHub: repository_link
Navigate to the project directory.
Install dependencies using npm or yarn: npm install or yarn install.
Start the development server: npm start or yarn start.
The application should open automatically in your default web browser at http://localhost:3000.


## Dependencies:
### React.js:
JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
### Axios: 
Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.


## Installation Instructions:
Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.
Clone the project repository from GitHub.
Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.
Run npm install or yarn install to install project dependencies.

## Configuration:
No special configuration is required. Ensure that you have an API key from Tomorrow.io, which should be stored securely. The API key is used to authenticate requests to the weather API.

## Testing:
Testing can be performed manually by entering different locations and verifying the displayed weather information. Unit tests and integration tests can be implemented using testing frameworks like Jest and React Testing Library.

## Issues and Troubleshooting:
###Invalid API key: 
Ensure that the API key is correctly configured and has the necessary permissions to access the Tomorrow.io API.
###Network errors: 
Check network connectivity and ensure that the API endpoint is accessible from your environment.
###Incorrect location format:
Verify that the location input is correctly formatted and can be recognized by the Tomorrow.io API.
